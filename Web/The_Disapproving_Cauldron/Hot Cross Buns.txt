get some delicious sultanas, flour, and anything you can find in the fridge (little surprise in the bun hurts nobody, in fact, a teeny bit of broccoli won't hurt anybody right?).

Did I mention that I don't know how to cook, well, rise, bake and gloss are the next steps, I'm too lazy to do more research...
